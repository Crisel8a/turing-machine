# Turing Machine
##Turing Machine Simulator
A Turing machine is a computing device, just like your computer. You
can think of it as a mechanism in which you write a word as input, and
it processes it and outputs yes or no depending on whether or not
such word satisfies a certain property. To understand this model, imagine an infinite tape divided in cells. Each cell either contains a symbol
or is blank, and there is a read-write head pointing to exactly one cell
at a time. https://turingmachinesimulator.com/
